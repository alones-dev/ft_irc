# **ðŸ’¬ ft_irc**

Welcome to **ft_irc**! ðŸš€ This is my very first C++ project at **42School**, following the **C++ Piscine**! ðŸŽ‰  
The goal of this project was to create a fully functional **IRC (Internet Relay Chat)** server that allows clients to connect, chat, and interact with each other in **real-time**. I worked on the **client-server connection** and most of the **commands** (like **WHOIS**, **MOTD**, and more), while collaborating with my teammates to handle the rest. Letâ€™s chat, build, and have fun with **ft_irc**! ðŸ˜„

## ðŸ”§ Usage
**1. Clone the repository**
```
git clone https://github.com/alones-dev/ft_irc.git
```
**2. Compile the project**
```
make
```
**3. Enjoy**
```
./ircserv [port] [password]
```
Example:
```
./ircserv 6666 test
```
***âžœ to connect to the server, you must use an IRC client such as ``irssi`` (used during project development) or netcat (``nc localhost 6666``).***
